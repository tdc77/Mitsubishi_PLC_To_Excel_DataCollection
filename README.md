# PythonPLCDataCollection

A very basic Mitsubishi PLC python data collection program. I will add better instructions later.
Use the ethernet card setup in the program for the Mitsubishi ethernet card.
This program will store the results in a excel sheet on your data collection pc.
Attached is better directions, I updated program to be easier to use.  The pymc_inst is just the pymcprotocol read/write data syntax file for easy lookup.
